            Hello everyone, my name Minh Tr√≠ and I am currently studying in the third semester of Software Engineering. 
            I am a very shy person when it comes to talking to strangers but is nice when people get to know me and I like
            making people around me laughs. I love playing games and watching memes as hobbies, I also like reading mangas a lot, 
            probably more than watching anime themselves. Although my skills are still pretty lacking but I hope I can 
            improve it more in the future so I can make a lot of money. :) <br>
            Thank you for reading this and I hope you enjoy my first ever website. <br>
